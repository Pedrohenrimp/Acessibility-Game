# Accessibility Game

**About:**

  This game consists of work from the Human-Computer Interface discipline, from the Computer Science course at the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) of Rio das Ostras, with the aim of explaining important basic concepts of accessibility in UX/UI Design in a relaxed way. and interactive.

*It is important to note that this game is not aimed at people who need accessibility features, but rather at developers who design applications and programs for public use, so that they can learn about basic accessibility concepts and be inspired to add these types of features. resources in your projects.*

The Game's proposal is to start in a completely inaccessible scenario:
 - With colors not at all adapted for color blind people;
 - No Visual Feedback;
 - No Auditory and Sound Feedback.


**Requirements:**
- Have Python installed on the machine.
- Have the game repository available locally.



**How ​​to play:**
 
  *To run the game, download the repository locally and, however you prefer, run the main.py code on your machine.*

   In the game, you control a bird, and you must collect coins to unlock new accessibility features.

As the player collects a certain amount of coins, they unlock new accessibility features:
- 5 coins: Unlocks the accessibility feature for color blind people, transforming the game's color palette into an accessible palette for this type of audience.
- 10 coins: Unlocks the accessibility feature for the deaf, now showing visual feedback illustrating the game's commands.
- 15 coins: Unlocks the accessibility feature for the blind and visually impaired, playing auditory feedback when text is shown on the screen, and enabling the game's sound features.


 With each new feature unlocked, a brief text is shown on the screen, explaining a little about the importance of each accessibility feature.

 The bird is influenced by gravity, so, in the absence of a movement command, the bird will fall with acceleration.

 The game ends when the bird collides with the upper or lower limit of the screen.
